School project



What does mini-project ? 


So, in a few words, this mini-project is "Logistic System" that allows to make add, edit, and remove; things like: packages, trucks, employes, states, citys, and check of payment.

The why?

I had the necessity of make this project for present on my last year of high school and be able to finish it; Of course, the institute provided programs an a few others languages of programming - software to make this possible but i decided to do this a web-project because i liked the idea and the meaning of that challenge for my personal and professional development.



Why didn't use anykind of framework?

Well, this is because in wanted to "improve" my vanilla skills and comprehension of JavaScript and my basic knowledge of PhP.




Why this project is written with spanish words?

Well, i am aware of that and its one of the restrictions that i had to deal because was one of the rules of the project.
